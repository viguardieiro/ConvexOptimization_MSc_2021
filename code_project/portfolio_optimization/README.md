# Multi-Period Portfolio Optimization

A portfolio manager oversees multiple assets and a bank account. For a specified number of stages, the manager wants to maximize his utility by dynamically reblanacing the portfolio.

The available implementation is deterministic (we know the values of all the variables at each stage).
